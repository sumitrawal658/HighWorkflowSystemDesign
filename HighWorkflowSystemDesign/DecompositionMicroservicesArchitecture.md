# Decomposition: Microservices Architecture

## Objective

The goal is to decompose the application into independent and modular services, ensuring the system achieves:

- **Scalability:** Each service can scale independently based on its workload.
- **Maintainability:** Modular structure simplifies debugging, updates, and deployment.
- **Fault Isolation:** Failures in one service do not affect the entire system, improving overall resilience.

## Approach

### Identify Business Domains

Break down the application's functionality into distinct business domains (e.g., User Management, Order Processing). Each business domain corresponds to a dedicated service, encapsulating the logic and operations relevant to that domain.

### Encapsulation

Each service owns its logic, database, and APIs. This promotes separation of concerns and reduces inter-service dependencies.

### Map Domains to Services

Define clear responsibilities for each service. Example services:

- **User Management Service**
- **Order Processing Service**
- **Payment Gateway Service**
- **Notification Service**

## Example Decomposition

### User Management Service

**Responsibilities:**

- User registration and login.
- Password reset and account recovery.
- Role-based access control (RBAC).
- Profile management (e.g., updating email, phone number).

**Operations:**

- Authenticate users with JWT or OAuth 2.0.
- Store user details in a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL).
- Maintain user session information in an in-memory database (e.g., Redis).

### Order Processing Service

**Responsibilities:**

- Create, update, and cancel orders.
- Track order status (e.g., Pending, Shipped, Delivered).
- Validate stock availability before order confirmation.

**Operations:**

- Expose APIs for creating and updating orders.
- Interact with the Inventory Service to verify stock.
- Store order data in a transactional database (e.g., MySQL).

### Payment Gateway Service

**Responsibilities:**

- Process payments via third-party providers (e.g., PayPal, Stripe).
- Handle refunds and payment disputes.
- Manage secure storage of payment metadata.

**Operations:**

- Implement APIs for payment initiation and status checks.
- Encrypt sensitive data (e.g., credit card info) using PCI-compliant techniques.
- Use event-driven architecture to notify other services (e.g., Order Service) about payment status.

### Notification Service

**Responsibilities:**

- Send notifications to users based on system triggers (e.g., order status updates).
- Handle multiple channels (email, SMS, push notifications).

**Operations:**

- Use a message broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) to process notification requests.
- Integrate with third-party APIs (e.g., Twilio, SendGrid) for message delivery.
- Maintain a log of sent notifications in a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB).

## Benefits of Decomposition

- **Independent Scaling:** Each service scales independently, optimizing resource usage. For example:
  - Scale the Payment Gateway Service during high transaction volumes.
  - Scale the Notification Service during marketing campaigns.
- **Service-Specific Maintenance:** Developers can work on one service without affecting others.
- **Fault Tolerance:** If the Notification Service fails, it does not impact the core functionality like Order Processing.
- **Technology Flexibility:** Different services can use the most suitable technology stack for their requirements.
