# Core Design Principles

This document outlines the core design principles for building a high-workload system using a microservices architecture. The focus is on scalability, reliability, and performance optimization.

## Microservices Architecture

### Decomposition

- **Objective:** Split the application into independent, domain-specific services.
- **Example Services:**
  - **User Management:** Handles user profiles, authentication, and authorization.
  - **Order Processing:** Manages order creation, updates, and tracking.
  - **Payment Gateway:** Processes payments and handles refunds.
  - **Notifications:** Sends notifications based on system events.

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

- **Define Bounded Contexts:** Isolate business logic into specific microservices.
  - **User Management:** Handles user profiles, authentication, and authorization.
  - **Order Management:** Manages order creation, updates, and tracking.
- **Use Aggregates:** Model business transactions to ensure data consistency.

### Stateless Services

- **Objective:** Maintain no user session state within services.
- **Implementation:** Use external systems (e.g., Redis) for session storage.
- **Benefit:** Enables seamless horizontal scaling.

### Event-Driven Design

- **Objective:** Use asynchronous communication for inter-service coordination.
- **Implementation:**
  - **Kafka Topics:** Trigger notifications when an order is placed.
  - **Event Sourcing:** Log events for replay and debugging.

## Components

### API Gateway

- **Responsibilities:** Centralized entry point for all clients (web, mobile, IoT devices).
- **Features:** Load balancing, request routing, authentication, caching, and rate limiting.
- **Examples:**
  - **Kong Gateway:** Open-source gateway for high performance.
  - **NGINX:** Versatile gateway supporting advanced configurations.
  - **AWS API Gateway:** Fully managed gateway for serverless systems.

### Service Layer

- **Services:**
  - **Authentication Service:** JWT or OAuth 2.0-based user authentication.
  - **Order Processing Service:** Handles order lifecycle (creation, payment, fulfillment).
  - **Inventory Management Service:** Tracks stock levels and handles low-stock alerts.
- **Frameworks:**
  - **Spring Boot:** Popular for Java-based microservices.
  - **Node.js:** Lightweight and efficient for real-time processing.
  - **NestJS:** TypeScript-based framework with built-in support for microservices.

### Communication

- **Synchronous:** Use REST APIs for synchronous calls.
- **Asynchronous:** Use gRPC for low-latency and high-throughput service-to-service communication.

### Database

- **Polyglot Persistence:**
  - **Relational Databases:** (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) For transactional data like orders.
  - **NoSQL Databases:** (e.g., MongoDB, DynamoDB) For unstructured or semi-structured data like product catalogs.
  - **In-memory Databases:** (e.g., Redis) For caching frequently accessed data, reducing database read/write load.
- **Scalability:**
  - **Sharding:** Partition databases based on user or geographic regions.
  - **Partitioning:** Segment data to enhance query performance.

### Caching

- **Objective:** Reduce latency and database load.
- **Tools:**
  - **Redis:** Key-value store for caching session data or hot data (e.g., top-selling products).
  - **Memcached:** Lightweight option for transient caching needs.

### Message Queue

- **Kafka:** Used for event streaming and processing.
  - **Example:** Trigger inventory updates or notifications when orders are created.
- **RabbitMQ:** Point-to-point messaging for synchronous tasks, such as sending OTPs.

### Batch Processing

- **Objective:** Handle bulk data processing.
- **Tool:** Apache Spark
  - **Examples:** Generate daily sales reports or perform data transformation for analytics.

### Monitoring and Observability

- **Objective:** Embed telemetry for distributed tracing and metric collection.
- **Tools:**
  - **Prometheus:** Monitor service metrics like response time and error rates.
  - **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana):**
    - **Elasticsearch:** Centralized log storage.
    - **Logstash:** Log aggregation.
    - **Kibana:** Visualization of logs and metrics.
  - **Jaeger or Zipkin:** Distributed tracing.
